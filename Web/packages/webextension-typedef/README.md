# webextension-typedef

This package contains a type definition for Web Extension API.

The code is based on [@types/webextension-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/webextension-polyfill), but since webextension-polyfill does not support Safari, this package only exposes type definitions.

Run `generate.sh` to download the latest type definitions and apply the patch.
