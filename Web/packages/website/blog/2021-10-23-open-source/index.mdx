The code for the Svadilfari app, extension, and related projects is now available on GitHub.

## Privacy Matters

Due to its nature, Svadilfari requires a permission to "execute scripts on all websites," and since it has access to all information displayed and entered on websites, the risk of misuse is high, and I have been receiving concerns about privacy.

With the release of the GitHub repository, anyone can view the scripts that run on Safari.

- [Web/packages/content](https://github.com/shumbo/Svadilfari/tree/main/Web/packages/content) contains the script that runs on web pages.
- [Web/packages/background](https://github.com/shumbo/Svadilfari/tree/main/Web/packages/background) has the script that runs on background
- [Web/packages/popup](https://github.com/shumbo/Svadilfari/tree/main/Web/packages/popup) contains the script that runs on popup

At this time, there is no guarantee that the code in this repository is actually published to the App Store. I will be looking into possibility of using GitHub Actions to automate the release flow so anyone can confirm safety of the released version of the app.

## For Developers

Safari Extensions have only just been supported in iOS 15, and I think that not much information has been made public.

In the course of development, I confirmed that some of the WebExtensions API behave differently from other browsers. Also the data exchange between the native app and extension is not always straightforward.

By releasing the source code, I hope it will be helpful for developers who work on Safari extensions.

Of course, I am also looking forward to receiving Issues and Pull Requests.
