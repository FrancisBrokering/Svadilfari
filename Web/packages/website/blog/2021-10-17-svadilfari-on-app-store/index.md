It has already been almost a month since the first release of Svadilfari. Thank you everyone for using the app, sharing [my tweet](https://twitter.com/shun_kashiwa/status/1440093614688780289) and featuring my app on various blogs and medias.

I'm pleased to announce that Svadilfari has appeared in the "App" tab of the Japan App Store.

import appStoreImage from './app-store.png';

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
  <img src={appStoreImage} alt="appstoreの画像" style={{maxWidth: "300px"}} />
</div>

The artwork is by my friend [@yotaszk](https://twitter.com/yotaszk). Thanks for accepting my request and finishing a high quality work in a short time.

You should be able to check the App Store in Japan for a few more days, so be sure to check the App Store App tab.
