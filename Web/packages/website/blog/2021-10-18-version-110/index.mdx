Svadilfari v1.1.0 is now available on the App Store. This version is the first update after the initial release and comes with several new features!

## New Features

### New Actions

As requested by many users, the following three new actions are now available.

1. Go Forward
1. Go Backward
1. Open URL

import newActions from "./new-actions.png";

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }} src={newActions} />
</div>

"Go Forward" and "Go Backward" are useful when using larger screens, and you can use "Open URL" to quickly open your favorite sites.

### Edit Gestures

You can now edit gestures! Simply tap the gesture and you can change the pattern, action and additional configuration if any.

import editGesture from "./edit-gesture.png";

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }} src={editGesture} />
</div>

### Gesture Sensitivity

A new "Gesture Sensitivity" setting has been added.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}
    src={require("./gesture-sensitivity.png").default}
  />
</div>

If the gesture is difficult to fire, try increasing the sensitivity.

### Dark Mode in Popup Menu

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}
    src={require("./popup-dark-mode.png").default}
  />
</div>

When using dark mode in the system, pop-ups will now also be displayed in dark mode.

## Other Improvements

- Gestures are no longer recognized when there are more than two fingers on the screen.
